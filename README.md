# About Me

sup' guys, gals and non-binary pals

- üáßüá∑ I'm a brazilian academic researcher @ USP-ICMC...
- ... with career background on Data (and MobileDev on darker times)...
- ... currently working with Integer Programming applied to Physician Scheduling!

- :octocat: Most of my projects are Data or Security related...
- ... cause I'm a huge self-hosting and network nerd.
